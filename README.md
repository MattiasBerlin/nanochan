# NanoChan

NanoChan is a program made to assist reading Japanese Visual Novels (VN). It takes the game's text and runs it through a dictionary and displays the English definitions of the words.

*Warning*: This project is early in development. A lot of the planned functionality is not yet implemented. Oh, and the name might be changed.
